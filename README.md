## WHERE

### Questions

1. Create a column that divides the ```standard_amt_usd``` by the ```standard_qty``` to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the ```id``` and ```account_id``` fields.

2. Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order. You will need to use only the columns that end with _usd. (Try to do this without using the total column.) Display the ```id``` and ```account_id``` fields also. Limit your calculations to the first 10 orders.
